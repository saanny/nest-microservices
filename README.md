# Task Manager Web Application

This is a simple web application designed to manage tasks within a company. The application is built upon a micro-service architecture with the following components:

1. **Nashville**: Backend for Frontend (BFF) responsible for handling REST and WebSocket communications.
2. **Gallatin**: Task Manager micro-service handling task logic.
3. **Ashland**: Logger micro-service for event logging.

## System Architecture

- Nashville communicates with Gallatin micro-service via GRPC.
- Gallatin and Ashland are connected to a RabbitMQ message broker.
- Gallatin emits logical events to Ashland for logging.

## Task Model

A task in the system has the following attributes:

- `id`: Universally unique identifier (UUID) for the task.
- `parentId`: UUID of the parent task (nullable for root tasks).
- `title`: Title of the task (string).
- `description`: Description of the task (text).
- `createdAt`: Date or timestamp automatically generated by the ORM upon task creation.
- `updatedAt`: Date or timestamp automatically updated by the ORM upon task modification.

## Functionality

The application provides the following functionalities:

1. **Create and Update Task**: Allows users to create and update tasks with basic attributes.
2. **List Tasks**: Provides a paginated list of tasks. Complicated pagination within the task tree is not implemented.
3. **Delete Task**: Enables users to delete a specific task by its ID.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install docker.
2. run `docker-compose up`.
